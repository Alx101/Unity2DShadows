# Unity 2D Shadows
This is an open-source Unity addon that allows you to easily create fully dynamic 2D lighting and shadows. The shadows are completely shader based and should work on Windows, OSX and WebGL (though with limitations to quality) builds. All code is commented and examples are available in the package, as well as a .unitypackage and a custom Editor within unity to set up the shadows to your liking.



Documentation to be added.
